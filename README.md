# Project_UOT - Vehicle Insurance Cross-Sell

## Overview

Top Insurer, a Toronto-based insurance company is growing rapidly in terms of selling new insurance products. The majority of Top Insurerâ€™s customer base are subscribers of the Health Insurance policy it has been offering over the past years.

This year, Top Insurer has introduced a new Vehicle Insurance and is keen on exploring ways to decipher if its policyholders (customers) would be interested in purchasing this new insurance policy.

A recent market survey has shown a healthy conversion rate of over 22% on selling new insurance policies to existing policyholders. Motivated by this, Top Insurer seeks for more nuanced analysis to be used as a basis for their marketing and sales strategies on the new Vehicle Insurance.
