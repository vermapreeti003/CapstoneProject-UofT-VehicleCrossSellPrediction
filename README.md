## Overview

Top Insurer, a Toronto-based insurance company is growing rapidly in terms of selling new insurance products. The majority of Top Insurer’s customer base are subscribers of the Health Insurance policy it has been offering over the past years.

This year, Top Insurer has introduced a new Vehicle Insurance and is keen on exploring ways to decipher if its policyholders (customers) would be interested in purchasing this new insurance policy.

A recent market survey has shown a healthy conversion rate of over 22% on selling new insurance policies to existing policyholders. Motivated by this, Top Insurer seeks for more nuanced analysis to be used as a basis for their marketing and sales strategies on the new Vehicle Insurance.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model that allows Top Insurer to classify its customer base based on its demographic and policy-related data. To achieve this objective we will use a dataset from Kaggle entitled [“Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?resource=download) and develop a predictive model using Python. The results of our analysis will help Top Insurer to inform its customer base segmentation for marketing and selling them the new Vehicle Insurance policy.


## Questions We Would Like to Answer:
      
 * What is the best classification model that predicts customers who are more suitable for Vehicle Insurance cross-selling?
 * What are the most important features that can help Top Insurer make informed marketing and sales decisions?
 * What tiers or customer groups should Top Insurer focus on while developing its strategies for the new vehicle insurance?
